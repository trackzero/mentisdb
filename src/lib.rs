//! # MentisDB
//!
//! **Durable, semantic, hash-chained memory for long-running and multi-agent systems.**
//!
//! MentisDB is a standalone Rust crate that gives AI agents (and the harnesses that run them)
//! a persistent, queryable, cryptographically verifiable memory substrate.
//!
//! It stores semantically typed thoughts in an append-only, hash-chained log. Every thought
//! carries type, role, timestamp, optional relations to prior thoughts, importance, confidence,
//! and cryptographic integrity. The system supports powerful hybrid retrieval (lexical + vector
//! + graph) with automatic synonym expansion via a built-in thesaurus.
//!
//! ## When to Use This Crate Directly
//!
//! Use `mentisdb` as a library when you are building a **custom integration** into an agentic
//! harness and want one or more of the following:
//!
//! - Full control over the memory lifecycle inside your process
//! - Custom storage backends (database, S3, encrypted volumes, in-memory, etc.)
//! - Lowest possible latency (no IPC to a daemon)
//! - Tight integration with your existing runtime, scheduler, or agent framework
//! - Ability to extend or replace parts of the retrieval pipeline
//!
//! If you just want to give existing agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, etc.) durable memory,
//! the [`mentisdb` daemon](https://github.com/CloudLLM-ai/mentisdb) + MCP/REST is usually simpler.
//!
//! ## Core Concepts
//!
//! - **[`Thought`]** — The fundamental unit. A typed, attributed, hash-chained record.
//! - **[`ThoughtInput`]** — What you provide when appending. The crate handles hashing, relations, and signing.
//! - **[`MentisDb`]** — The main handle. Owns the in-memory chain + indexes + storage adapter.
//! - **[`StorageAdapter`]** — The pluggable persistence layer. Implement this for custom backends.
//! - **Ranked Retrieval** — [`RankedSearchQuery`] + [`query_ranked`](MentisDb::query_ranked) gives you the full
//!   hybrid (lexical + vector + graph + thesaurus + RRF) experience.
//! - **Skill Registry** — Versioned, immutable instruction bundles for agents (git-like).
//!
//! ## Getting Started — Embedding in Your Harness
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! use std::path::PathBuf;
//! use mentisdb::{MentisDb, ThoughtInput, ThoughtType};
//!
//! # fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
//! // Open (or create) a durable chain
//! let mut chain = MentisDb::open_with_key(
//!     PathBuf::from("/var/lib/my-agent/memories"),
//!     "project-alpha"
//! )?;
//!
//! // Append a decision
//! chain.append_thought(
//!     "planner",
//!     ThoughtInput::new(
//!         ThoughtType::Decision,
//!         "We will use MentisDB as the single source of truth for project memory"
//!     )
//! )?;
//!
//! // Powerful ranked search (thesaurus is automatic since 0.9.9)
//! let results = chain.query_ranked(
//!     &mentisdb::RankedSearchQuery::new()
//!         .with_text("memory durability")
//!         .with_limit(10)
//! );
//!
//! for hit in results.hits {
//!     println!("{}: {}", hit.thought.id, hit.thought.content);
//! }
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Extension Points for Custom Integrations
//!
//! | Need                              | Extension Point                          |
//! |-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
//! | Custom persistence                | [`StorageAdapter`] trait                 |
//! | Custom vector / embedding backend | Managed vector sidecars + [`search`] module |
//! | Custom retrieval logic            | Build on top of [`RankedSearchQuery`] + indexes |
//! | Versioned agent instructions      | [`SkillRegistry`]                        |
//! | Cryptographic provenance          | [`signable_thought_payload`] + Ed25519 keys |
//! | Real-time notifications           | Webhooks (`webhooks` module)             |
//!
//! ## Concurrency Model
//!
//! - `&MentisDb` is `Send + Sync`.
//! - Multiple threads can safely perform reads concurrently.
//! - Writes require `&mut self`. For highly concurrent write workloads, either
//!   serialize through a single writer task or run the daemon and talk to it over HTTP/MCP.
//!
//! ## Error Handling
//!
//! Most fallible operations return `std::io::Result`. Storage errors, hash-chain
//! integrity violations, and invalid references surface as `io::Error`. Higher-level
//! semantic errors (e.g. LLM extraction) use dedicated error types in the `llm` module.
//!
//! ## Custom Integration Patterns
//!
//! ### Direct Embedding vs Daemon
//!
//! | Approach              | Best For                                      | Trade-offs |
//! |-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------|
//! | Embed the crate       | Custom harnesses, maximum control, low latency | You manage storage, concurrency, lifecycle |
//! | Use the daemon (MCP/REST) | Existing agent tools, quick integration     | Small IPC overhead, simpler for most users |
//!
//! Most serious custom integrations embed the crate directly.
//!
//! ### Recommended Architecture
//!
//! ```text
//! Your Agent Runtime
//!        │
//!        ▼
//! MentisDb (in-process)
//!   ├── StorageAdapter (your choice)
//!   ├── Vector Sidecars (optional)
//!   └── Skill Registry
//! ```
//!
//! Keep one long-lived `MentisDb` instance per logical "brain" (usually per project or user).
//!
//! ### Working with Skills from Rust
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! use mentisdb::SkillRegistry;
//!
//! let registry = SkillRegistry::open(&path)?;
//! let skill = registry.read_latest("my-agent-primer")?;
//! ```
//!
//! Skills are versioned and immutable — perfect for agent instruction management.
//!
//! ### Thought Signing & Provenance
//!
//! For multi-tenant or high-trust environments you can sign thoughts:
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! let payload = mentisdb::signable_thought_payload("agent-42", &input);
//! let signature = ed25519_sign(&payload, &private_key);
//! input.signing_key_id = Some("key-7".into());
//! input.thought_signature = Some(signature);
//! ```
//!
//! ### Vector Sidecars when Embedding
//!
//! You can register embedding providers directly:
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! use mentisdb::search::LocalTextEmbeddingProvider;
//!
//! chain.register_managed_vector_sidecar(
//!     ManagedVectorProviderKind::LocalTextV1,
//!     None, // use default model
//! )?;
//! ```
//!
//! ## Advanced Topics
//!
//! - **Deduplication**: Set `dedup_threshold` at open time for automatic `Supersedes` relations.
//! - **Implicit Graph**: The `ImplicitEdgeOverlay` adds semantic edges based on vector similarity.
//! - **RRF Reranking**: Enable on `RankedSearchQuery` when lexical and vector signals disagree.
//! - **Federated Search**: Search across multiple chains (including branches) in one call.
//!
//! ## Testing Custom Integrations
//!
//! The crate is designed to be highly testable:
//!
//! - Use `BinaryStorageAdapter` with a temp directory for realistic integration tests.
//! - Implement a simple in-memory `StorageAdapter` for fast unit tests.
//! - The search quality research harnesses (`tests/search_quality_research.rs`) are excellent real-world examples.
//!
//! ## Cookbook: Common Patterns
//!
//! ### Long-lived Brain
//!
//! Open once at startup and keep the handle for the lifetime of the process.
//!
//! ### Background Vector Work
//!
//! Rebuild vector sidecars in a background task so the main agent loop is never blocked.
//!
//! ### Self-Improving Loop
//!
//! Agent reads skill → runs → reflects → uploads improved skill version (history is preserved forever).
//!
//! ## Skill Registry from Rust
//!
//! MentisDB includes a powerful, versioned skill registry (git-like for agent instructions).
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! use mentisdb::SkillRegistry;
//!
//! let mut registry = SkillRegistry::open(&path)?;
//!
//! // Upload a new version of a skill
//! let upload = SkillUpload {
//!     skill_id: Some("my-agent-system-prompt".into()),
//!     content: include_str!("skills/system.md").to_string(),
//!     format: SkillFormat::Markdown,
//!     ..Default::default()
//! };
//!
//! registry.upload(&upload, "planner-agent")?;
//!
//! // Read the latest version for an agent at runtime
//! let skill = registry.read_latest("my-agent-system-prompt")?;
//! println!("{}", skill.latest_content);
//! ```
//!
//! Skills are immutable once uploaded. Old versions remain available forever for audit and rollback.
//!
//! ## Thought Signing & Cryptographic Provenance
//!
//! For multi-tenant systems or high-trust environments, you can cryptographically sign thoughts:
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! use mentisdb::signable_thought_payload;
//!
//! let payload = signable_thought_payload("agent-42", &input);
//! let signature = ed25519_sign(&payload, &my_private_key);
//!
//! input.signing_key_id = Some("key-7".to_string());
//! input.thought_signature = Some(signature);
//!
//! chain.append_thought("agent-42", input)?;
//! ```
//!
//! The daemon and clients can later verify signatures using the agent's registered public keys.
//!
//! ## Vector Sidecar Management (When Embedding)
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! // Register the built-in fastembed provider
//! chain.register_managed_vector_sidecar(
//!     ManagedVectorProviderKind::LocalTextV1,
//!     Some("all-MiniLM-L6-v2".to_string()), // model name
//! )?;
//!
//! // Later check status
//! let status = chain.vector_sidecar_status()?;
//! println!("Indexed {} thoughts", status.thought_count);
//! ```
//!
//! You can also bring your own embedding provider by implementing the traits in the `search` module.
//!
//! ## Error Handling & Durability
//!
//! - Most operations return `std::io::Result`.
//! - Storage errors, I/O failures, and hash-chain integrity violations are `io::Error`.
//! - Always call `flush()` before process exit if `auto_flush` is disabled.
//! - Use `dedup_threshold` for automatic `Supersedes` relations on near-duplicate content.
//!
//! ## Production Considerations for Custom Harnesses
//!
//! - Open the chain once at startup and keep the handle alive for the lifetime of the process.
//! - Consider running vector sidecar rebuilds in a background task on large chains.
//! - For extremely high write throughput from many threads, either serialize writes or use the daemon over HTTP/MCP.
//! - Monitor implicit edge overlay size on chains with >50k thoughts.
//! - Prefer the provided environment variable configuration (`MENTISDB_*`) for consistency with the daemon.
//! - Always call `flush()` before shutdown unless `auto_flush` is enabled.
//! - Use the backup/restore APIs (`backup` module) for disaster recovery and chain migration.
//!
//! ## Resilience & Durability
//!
//! MentisDB is designed for durability:
//!
//! - Every append produces a cryptographic hash chained to the previous thought.
//! - The `invalidated_thought_ids` set provides O(1) exclusion of superseded content
//!   from default search, ranked search, context bundles, and related retrieval.
//! - The skill registry is itself versioned and immutable.
//! - Full chain backups (`.mentis` files) are self-contained and verifiable.
//!
//! When building a custom integration, treat `MentisDb` as the source of truth
//! for agent state. Combine it with your own replication/backup strategy if you
//! need geographic redundancy.
//!
//! ## Next Steps for Integrators
//!
//! 1. Start with the examples above.
//! 2. Read the [Whitepaper](https://github.com/CloudLLM-ai/mentisdb/blob/master/WHITEPAPER.md).
//! 3. Study the test suite — it is full of realistic, battle-tested patterns.
//! 4. Explore the `search` module if you need advanced retrieval control.
//! 5. Reach out on GitHub if you're designing something unusual — we're happy to help shape the APIs.
//!
//! ## Common Pitfalls for New Integrators
//!
//! - Using the legacy `open()` method instead of `open_with_key`.
//! - Forgetting to call `flush()` on shutdown when `auto_flush` is false.
//! - Expecting `Thought` to be mutable (it is not — always append new thoughts).
//! - Trying to do very high-concurrency writes directly on a single `MentisDb` instance without serialization.
//! - Not using `refs` / relations when there is clear causality between thoughts.
//!
//! ---
//!
//! This crate is the foundation of the MentisDB ecosystem. Everything else
//! (daemon, MCP/REST server, dashboard, Python client, etc.) is built on top
//! of the stable, well-documented APIs you see here.
//!
//! We designed MentisDB to be infrastructure you can trust for years. Welcome.

///
/// Each record is stored as a length-prefixed bincode-serialized [`Thought`],
/// keeping append operations simple while avoiding JSON parse overhead on
/// reload.
///
/// ## Write buffering
///
/// When `auto_flush = true` (the default), appends are queued to a dedicated
/// background writer and the caller blocks until the writer flushes them to the
/// OS. Concurrent requests can share a short group-commit window, preserving
/// durable-ack semantics while reducing contention on highly concurrent write
/// workloads.
///
/// When `auto_flush = false`, appends are handed to a bounded background-writer
/// queue. The worker batches records and flushes them to disk every
/// [`FLUSH_THRESHOLD`] entries (or when the adapter is explicitly flushed or
/// dropped). This mode dramatically increases batch-append throughput at the
/// cost of potentially losing the current in-memory batch plus any queued
/// acknowleded appends on a hard crash.
///
/// ## Clone behaviour
///
/// Cloning creates a *new* adapter for the same file path with a fresh, empty
/// write state (no background writer). The clone shares no state with the
/// original. **Do not use both the original and the clone for writes
/// concurrently** — each maintains its own in-memory view of the chain tip
/// (`prev_hash`), so concurrent appends will produce records whose `prev_hash`
/// values don't link, corrupting the hash chain. Use clones only as read-only
/// views of the same file.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```rust,no_run
/// use std::path::PathBuf;
/// use mentisdb::{BinaryStorageAdapter, StorageAdapter};
///
/// let adapter = BinaryStorageAdapter::for_chain_key(PathBuf::from("/tmp/tc_bin"), "agent-memory");
/// assert!(adapter.storage_location().ends_with(".tcbin"));
