# MentisDB

MentisDB is a **durable semantic memory engine and versioned skill registry** for AI agents — a persistent, hash-chained brain that survives context resets, model swaps, and team turnover.

It stores semantically typed thoughts in an append-only, hash-chained memory log through a swappable storage adapter layer. The skill registry is a git-like immutable version store for agent instruction bundles — every upload is a new version, history is never overwritten, and every version is cryptographically signable.

---

## Why MentisDB

**Harness Swapping** — the same durable memory works across every AI coding environment. Connect Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, GitHub Copilot CLI, Qwen Code, Cursor, VS Code, or any MCP-capable host to the same `mentisdb` daemon and your agents share one brain, regardless of which tool you picked up today.

**Zero Knowledge Loss Across Context Boundaries** — when an agent's context window fills, it writes a `Summary` checkpoint to MentisDB, compacts, reloads `mentisdb_recent_context`, and continues without losing a single decision. Chat history is ephemeral. MentisDB is permanent.

**Fleet Orchestration at Scale** — one project manager agent decomposes work, dispatches a parallel fleet of specialists, each pre-warmed with shared memory, and synthesizes results wave by wave. MentisDB is the coordination substrate: every agent reads from the same chain and writes its lessons back. The fleet's collective intelligence compounds.

**Versioned Skill Registry** — skills are not just stored, they are versioned like a git repository. Every upload to an existing `skill_id` creates a new immutable version (stored as a unified diff). Any historical version is reconstructable. Skills can be deprecated or revoked while full audit history is preserved. Permanent delete is the explicit exception: it removes the skill and all versions so the same `skill_id` can be reused. Uploading agents with registered Ed25519 keys must cryptographically sign their uploads — provenance is verifiable, not assumed.

**Session Resurrection** — any agent can call `mentisdb_recent_context` and immediately know exactly where the project stands, what decisions were made, what traps were already hit, and what comes next — without re-reading code, re-running exploratory searches, or asking the human to re-explain context that was earned through hours of work.

**Self-Improving Agent Fleets** — agents upload updated skill files after learning something new. A skill checked in at the start of a project is better by the end of it. Combine with Ed25519 signing to create a verifiable, tamper-evident record of which agent authored which version of institutional knowledge.

**Multi-Agent Shared Brain** — multiple agents, multiple roles, multiple owners can write to the same chain key simultaneously. Every thought carries a stable `agent_id`. Queries filter by agent identity, thought type, role, tags, concepts, importance, and time windows. The chain represents the full collective intelligence of an entire orchestration system, not just one session.

**Lessons That Outlive Models** — architectural decisions, hard constraints, non-obvious failure modes, and retrospectives written to MentisDB survive chat loss, model upgrades, and team changes. The knowledge compounds instead of evaporating. A new engineer or a new agent boots up, loads the chain, and inherits everything the team learned.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

#### macOS

Install the Xcode Command Line Tools (required for native crates):

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

#### Ubuntu / Debian

On a fresh Ubuntu or Debian system you need a few development packages before `cargo install` will succeed (especially because the default build enables audio support for the TUI startup chime).

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y \
    build-essential \
    pkg-config \
    libssl-dev \
    libasound2-dev \
    curl
```

Then install Rust (if you don't already have it):

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source "$HOME/.cargo/env"
```

**Headless servers / minimal installs**

If you are installing on a server and do not want the startup sound (and the ALSA dependency), install without the default features:

```bash
cargo install mentisdb --no-default-features --features server
```

This produces a smaller binary with no audio dependencies.

---

## Quick Start

Install the daemon (after completing the platform-specific prerequisites above):

```bash
cargo install mentisdb --features local-embeddings
```

The `local-embeddings` feature enables the built-in `fastembed-minilm` ONNX embedding provider for real semantic vector search. Without it, MentisDB falls back to `local-text-v1` (text hashing). The auto-updater also installs with `--features local-embeddings`.

Connect your local AI tools the fast way:

```bash
mentisdb wizard
```

Or target one integration explicitly:

```bash
mentisdb setup codex
mentisdb setup all --dry-run
mentisdb wizard
mentisdb add "The sky is blue"
mentisdb search "cache invalidation" --limit 5 --scope session
mentisdb agents
```

Then start the daemon:

```bash
mentisdb
```

When run in an interactive terminal, `mentisdb` launches a **full TUI** with
scrollable panes for configuration, chain/agent/skill tables, and a live event
log. On an interactive first run with no configured client integrations, it
offers to launch the setup wizard immediately after startup so you do not have
to guess the next command.

Run persistently after closing your SSH session:

```bash
nohup mentisdb &
```

**Headless mode.** The daemon now auto-promotes to headless HTTP mode
whenever stdin or stdout is not a TTY — so every common non-interactive
launch (Docker without `-t`, `nohup mentisdb &`, `systemd` without
`StandardInput=tty`, `cron`, an SSH session that was disconnected) gets
the right behavior automatically without you having to remember the
flag. To force the headless code path on a machine that does have a
TTY (for testing, or to suppress the dashboard), pass the explicit
flag:

```bash
mentisdb --headless               # HTTP/MCP/REST only, no TUI
mentisdb --mode http --headless   # equivalent; the stdio-proxy form
```

Both forms are accepted in either flag order. `mentisdb --help` lists the
flag in the Usage block and gives a full description under Flags.

Modern MCP clients bootstrap themselves from the MCP handshake:

- `initialize.instructions` tells the agent to read `mentisdb://skill/core`
- `resources/read(mentisdb://skill/core)` delivers the embedded operating skill
- `GET /mentisdb_skill_md` remains available only as a compatibility fallback

If you need to wire a tool manually, here are the raw MCP commands/configs:

```bash
# Claude Code
claude mcp add --transport http mentisdb http://127.0.0.1:9471

# OpenAI Codex
codex mcp add mentisdb --url http://127.0.0.1:9471

# Qwen Code
qwen mcp add --transport http mentisdb http://127.0.0.1:9471

# GitHub Copilot CLI — use /mcp add in interactive mode,
# or write ~/.copilot/mcp-config.json manually (see below)
```

---

## What Is In This Folder

`mentisdb/` contains:

- the standalone `mentisdb` library crate
- server support for HTTP MCP and REST, enabled by default
- the `mentisdb` daemon binary
- dedicated tests under `mentisdb/tests`

---

## Makefile

A `Makefile` is included at the repository root. All common workflows have a target:

```bash
make build          # fmt + release build
make build-mentisdb # build only the daemon binary
make release        # fmt, check, clippy, build, test, doc in sequence
make fmt            # cargo fmt
make check          # cargo check (lib + binary)
make clippy         # cargo fmt + clippy --all-targets -D warnings
make test           # cargo test
make bench          # Criterion benchmarks, output tee'd to /tmp/mentisdb_bench_results.txt
make doc            # cargo doc --all-features
make install        # cargo install --path . --locked --features local-embeddings
make publish        # cargo publish
make publish-dry-run
make clean
make help           # list all targets with descriptions
```

---

## Build

```bash
make build
```

Or directly with Cargo:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

Build only the library without the default daemon/server stack:

```bash
cargo build --no-default-features
```

---

## Test

```bash
make test
```

Or directly:

```bash
cargo test
```

Run tests for the library-only build:

```bash
cargo test --no-default-features
```

Run rustdoc tests:

```bash
cargo test --doc
```

---

## Benchmarks

MentisDB ships a Criterion benchmark suite and a harness-free HTTP concurrency benchmark:

```bash
make bench
```

Or directly:

```bash
cargo bench
```

Results are also written to `/tmp/mentisdb_bench_results.txt` so numbers persist across terminal sessions.

Benchmark coverage:

- `benches/thought_chain.rs` — 10 benchmarks: append throughput, query latency, traversal patterns
- `benches/search_baseline.rs` — 4 benchmarks: lexical/filter-first search baseline over content, registry text, indexed+text intersections, and newest-tail limits
- `benches/search_ranked.rs` — 4 benchmarks: additive ranked retrieval over lexical content, filtered ranked queries, and heuristic fallback, plus a baseline append-order comparison
- `benches/skill_registry.rs` — 12 benchmarks: skill upload, search, delta reconstruction, lifecycle
- `benches/http_concurrency.rs` — starts `mentisdb` in-process on a random port; measures write and read throughput at 100 / 1k / 10k concurrent Tokio tasks with p50/p95/p99 latency reporting

Baseline numbers from the `DashMap` concurrent chain lookup refactor: **750–930 read req/s at 10k concurrent tasks**, compared to a sequential bottleneck on the previous `RwLock<HashMap>` implementation.

---

## Generate Docs

```bash
make doc
```

Or directly:

```bash
cargo doc --no-deps
```

Generate docs for the library-only build:

```bash
cargo doc --no-deps --no-default-features
```

---

## Run The Daemon

The standalone executable is `mentisdb`.

Run it from source:

```bash
cargo run --bin mentisdb
```

Install it from the crate directory:

```bash
make install
# or
cargo install --path . --locked
```

`mentisdb` now owns both daemon startup and local integration setup:

```bash
mentisdb setup codex
mentisdb setup all --dry-run
mentisdb wizard
mentisdb add "The sky is blue"
mentisdb search "cache invalidation" --limit 5 --scope session
mentisdb agents
mentisdb
```

When it starts, it serves:

- an MCP server
- a REST server
- an HTTPS web dashboard

Before serving traffic, it:

- migrates or reconciles discovered chains to the current schema and default storage adapter
- verifies chain integrity and attempts repair from valid local sources when possible
- migrates the skill registry from V1 to V2 format if needed (idempotent; safe to run repeatedly)
- migrates chain relations from V2 to V3 format to add temporal edge validity (`valid_at`/`invalid_at`) if needed (idempotent; safe to run repeatedly)

Once startup completes, it prints:

- the active chain directory, default chain key, and bound MCP/REST/dashboard addresses
- a catalog of all exposed HTTP endpoints with one-line descriptions
- a per-chain summary with version, adapter, thought count, and per-agent counts

---

## Daemon Configuration

`mentisdb` is configured with environment variables:

- `MENTISDB_DIR`
  Directory where MentisDB storage adapters store chain files.
- `MENTISDB_DEFAULT_CHAIN_KEY`
  Default `chain_key` used when requests omit one. Default: `borganism-brain`.
  `MENTISDB_DEFAULT_KEY` is accepted as a deprecated alias.
- `MENTISDB_STORAGE_ADAPTER`
  Default storage backend for newly created chains. Only `binary` is supported for
  new chains (JSONL is deprecated — existing JSONL chains remain readable).
  Default: `binary`
- `MENTISDB_VERBOSE`
  When unset, verbose interaction logging defaults to `true`. Supported explicit values:
  `1`, `0`, `true`, `false`.
- `MENTISDB_LOG_FILE`
  Optional path for interaction logs. When set, MentisDB writes interaction logs to that file
  even if console verbosity is disabled. If `MENTISDB_VERBOSE=true`, the same lines are also
  mirrored to the console logger.
- `MENTISDB_BIND_HOST`
  Bind host for both HTTP servers. Default: `127.0.0.1`
- `MENTISDB_MCP_PORT`
  MCP server port. Default: `9471`
- `MENTISDB_REST_PORT`
  REST server port. Default: `9472`
- `MENTISDB_DASHBOARD_PORT`
  HTTPS dashboard port. Default: `9475`. Set to `0` to disable the web dashboard.
- `MENTISDB_DASHBOARD_PIN`
  Optional PIN required to access the dashboard. Leave unset only for trusted localhost use.
- `MENTISDB_BEARER_TOKEN_ACCESS`
  Require bearer tokens for MCP requests. Default: `false`. Set `true` for remote
  or multi-user MCP servers. This can also be toggled live from the dashboard Settings screen.
- `MENTISDB_AUTO_FLUSH`
  Controls per-write durability of the `binary` storage adapter.
  - `true` (default): every `append_thought` flushes to disk immediately. Full durability.
  - `false`: writes are batched and flushed every 16 appends (`FLUSH_THRESHOLD`). Up to 15
    thoughts may be lost on a hard crash or power failure, but write throughput increases
    significantly for multi-agent hubs with many concurrent writers.
  Supported values: `1`, `0`, `true`, `false`. Has no effect on the `jsonl` adapter.
- `MENTISDB_GROUP_COMMIT_MS`
  Group-commit window in milliseconds for the background binary writer.
  The writer batches appends within this window before flushing to disk.
  Lower values = lower latency; higher values = better throughput.
  Default: `2`
- `MENTISDB_UPDATE_CHECK`
  Background GitHub release check for `mentisdb`. Enabled by default; set `0`, `false`, `no`,
  or `off` to disable update checks after startup. Default: `true`
- `MENTISDB_UPDATE_REPO`
  Optional GitHub `owner/repo` override used by the updater. Default: `CloudLLM-ai/mentisdb`
- `MENTISDB_HTTPS_MCP_PORT`
  HTTPS MCP server port. Default: `9473`. Set to `0` to disable HTTPS MCP.
- `MENTISDB_HTTPS_REST_PORT`
  HTTPS REST server port. Default: `9474`. Set to `0` to disable HTTPS REST.
- `MENTISDB_TLS_CERT`
  Path to a PEM-encoded TLS certificate for the HTTPS servers and dashboard.
  Default: `<MENTISDB_DIR>/tls/cert.pem`
- `MENTISDB_TLS_KEY`
  Path to a PEM-encoded TLS private key for the HTTPS servers and dashboard.
  Default: `<MENTISDB_DIR>/tls/key.pem`
- `MENTISDB_STARTUP_SOUND`
  Play the 4-note "men-tis-D-B" startup jingle. Default: `true`. Set `0`, `false`, `no`,
  or `off` to silence.
- `MENTISDB_THOUGHT_SOUNDS`
  Play unique short sounds for thought types on append (square-wave, 250–1,000 Hz) and
  for read operations (sine-wave, 2,500–4,500 Hz). Default: `false`. Set `1`, `true`,
  `yes`, or `on` to enable.
- `MENTISDB_DEDUP_THRESHOLD`
  Jaccard similarity threshold for automatic deduplication on append (0.0–1.0). When
  unset, auto-dedup is **disabled** (library and daemon default). When set, a new
  thought whose content is sufficiently similar to a recent thought gets an automatic
  `Supersedes` edge to that prior thought (the prior stays on disk for audit).
  **Recommended for multi-agent and long-lived chains:** `0.85`. Without this (or
  without agents writing `Supersedes` / `Corrects` / `Invalidates`), the invalidation
  set stays empty and search cannot hide near-duplicate noise.
- `MENTISDB_DEDUP_SCAN_WINDOW`
  Number of recent thoughts to scan for dedup comparison. Default: `64`. Only used
  when `MENTISDB_DEDUP_THRESHOLD` is set. Raise on chatty chains (e.g. `128`).

#### Invalidation and “current” memory

MentisDB never deletes corrected or superseded thoughts. Instead it maintains an
in-memory `invalidated_thought_ids` set for any thought that is the **target** of a
later `Supersedes`, `Corrects`, or `Invalidates` relation.

**Default retrieval** (`query`, ranked search, context bundles, recent context, memory
markdown export, REST/MCP search) **excludes** those IDs so agents see current memory.
Pass `include_invalidated=true` (crate: `ThoughtQuery::with_include_invalidated(true)` /
`RankedSearchQuery::with_include_invalidated(true)`) for audit archaeology.

Point-in-time `as_of` still returns thoughts that were valid at that timestamp, even
if they were superseded later.

How the set gets filled:

1. **Agents** write typed edges (`Supersedes` / `Corrects` / `Invalidates`) — the
   MentisDB skill’s search-before-write habit.
2. **Auto-dedup** when `MENTISDB_DEDUP_THRESHOLD` is set (see above).

Search filtering alone does not invent edges; pair default exclusion with dedup and/or
good agent discipline on long-running brains.

MentisDB loads environment variables from a `.env` file in the current working directory
at startup. Existing shell environment variables take precedence over `.env` values. The
file is silently ignored when absent, so it is safe to commit a template `.env.example`
while keeping your actual `.env` in `.gitignore`.

Example — full durability (production default):

```bash
MENTISDB_DIR=/tmp/mentisdb \
MENTISDB_DEFAULT_CHAIN_KEY=borganism-brain \
MENTISDB_STORAGE_ADAPTER=binary \
MENTISDB_VERBOSE=true \
MENTISDB_LOG_FILE=/tmp/mentisdb/mentisdb.log \
MENTISDB_BIND_HOST=127.0.0.1 \
MENTISDB_MCP_PORT=9471 \
MENTISDB_REST_PORT=9472 \
MENTISDB_DASHBOARD_PIN=change-me \
MENTISDB_AUTO_FLUSH=true \
cargo run --bin mentisdb
```

Example — multi-agent / long-lived chain (recommended: enable near-duplicate superseding):

```bash
MENTISDB_DIR=/var/lib/mentisdb \
MENTISDB_AUTO_FLUSH=true \
MENTISDB_DEDUP_THRESHOLD=0.85 \
MENTISDB_DEDUP_SCAN_WINDOW=64 \
MENTISDB_BIND_HOST=0.0.0.0 \
mentisdb
```

Example — high-throughput write mode (multi-agent hub):

```bash
MENTISDB_DIR=/var/lib/mentisdb \
MENTISDB_AUTO_FLUSH=false \
MENTISDB_BIND_HOST=0.0.0.0 \
mentisdb
```

### Automatic Update Check

`mentisdb` checks GitHub releases in the background after startup and can offer
to update itself with `cargo install`.

- checks are enabled by default
- version comparison uses only the first three numeric components, so a tag like
  `0.6.1.14` is treated as core version `0.6.1`
- interactive terminals get an ASCII prompt window with `Y` / `N`
- non-interactive terminals never block; they print the exact manual `cargo install` command instead

Disable the automatic check:

```bash
MENTISDB_UPDATE_CHECK=0 \
mentisdb
```

### Append Thought — `POST /v1/thoughts`

```json
{
  "chain_key":      "my-chain",
  "agent_id":       "my-agent",
  "agent_name":     "My Agent",
  "thought_type":   "LessonLearned",
  "role":           "Execution",
  "content":        "...",
  "scope":          "session",
  "tags":           ["tag1"],
  "concepts":       ["concept1"],
  "entity_type":    "incident",
  "source_episode": "triage-2026-04-17",
  "importance":     0.9,
  "confidence":     0.8,
  "refs":           [14, 22],
  "relations": [
    { "kind": "CausedBy",      "target_id": "<uuid>" },
    { "kind": "ContinuesFrom", "target_id": "<uuid>", "chain_key": "other-chain" },
    { "kind": "Supersedes",    "target_id": "<uuid>", "valid_at": "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z", "invalid_at": "2025-12-31T23:59:59Z" }
  ]
}
```

`chain_key`, `role`, `scope`, `tags`, `concepts`, `entity_type`, `source_episode`, `importance`, `confidence`, `refs`, and `relations` are optional.  
`relations[].kind` accepts: `References`, `Summarizes`, `Corrects`, `Invalidates`, `CausedBy`, `Supports`, `Contradicts`, `DerivedFrom`, `ContinuesFrom`, `BranchesFrom`, `RelatedTo`, `Supersedes`.  
`relations[].chain_key` is optional — omit for intra-chain edges, set for cross-chain references.  
`relations[].valid_at` and `relations[].invalid_at` are optional RFC 3339 timestamps that define when a relation edge is temporally valid, enabling point-in-time queries with `as_of`.  
`entity_type` is an optional per-chain ontology label (e.g. `"incident"`, `"customer"`, `"deploy"`) used by the dashboard explorer and by ranked-search filtering.  
`source_episode` is an optional free-form provenance string (e.g. a conversation id or batch name) that groups thoughts by the episode they were derived from; it is also filterable in ranked search.

---

## Search Semantics

MentisDB keeps its baseline thought search surface **filter-first and append-order**. Ranked, graph-aware, and vector retrieval are additive surfaces layered on top of that stable baseline.

**Ranked search now automatically expands queries** using the built-in static thesaurus (~900 headwords + 300+ irregular verb lemmas) for better recall on vocabulary mismatch and verb-form variation. No client changes or extra parameters are required — the expansion is applied transparently to every text-bearing ranked query (REST, MCP, dashboard, and CLI).

Today, the main search APIs are:

- `MentisDb::query(&ThoughtQuery)`
- `POST /v1/search`
- `mentisdb_search`

Current behavior:

- indexed filters narrow the candidate set for `thought_type`, `role`, `agent_id`, tags, and concepts
- `text` is a case-insensitive substring match over:
  - thought `content`
  - `agent_id`
  - tags
  - concepts
  - agent-registry display name, aliases, owner, and description
- results are returned in **append order**
- `limit` keeps the **newest matching tail** after filtering rather than applying a ranking score

That means plain `ThoughtQuery` / `/v1/search` behavior is deterministic and explainable, but that baseline path is **not** BM25, hybrid, or vector retrieval. Additive ranked and graph-aware retrieval now exist on separate crate, REST, and MCP surfaces.

Examples:

```rust,no_run
use mentisdb::{MentisDb, ThoughtQuery, ThoughtType};
use std::path::PathBuf;

# fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
let chain = MentisDb::open(&PathBuf::from("/tmp/tc_query"), "agent1", "Agent", None, None)?;

let lexical = ThoughtQuery::new()
    .with_types(vec![ThoughtType::Decision])
    .with_tags_any(["search"])
    .with_text("latency");

let results = chain.query(&lexical);
# let _ = results;
# Ok(())
# }
```

```json
{
  "chain_key": "mentisdb",
  "thought_types": ["Decision"],
  "tags_any": ["search"],
  "text": "latency",
  "limit": 20
}
```

Design note:

- treat this lexical/filter-first behavior as the baseline
- keep ranked, vector, and hybrid retrieval as additive, explicitly documented surfaces on top of that baseline
- do not silently change the semantics of `ThoughtQuery` or `/v1/search` from append-order filtering to score-ranked retrieval

The dedicated benchmark `benches/search_baseline.rs` and evaluation tests in `tests/search_eval_tests.rs` are intended to preserve that baseline while world-class search evolves.

### Ranked Search

MentisDB now also exposes an additive ranked-search surface for direct crate use:

- `RankedSearchQuery`
- `RankedSearchGraph`
- `MentisDb::query_context_bundles(&RankedSearchQuery)`
- `MentisDb::query_ranked(&RankedSearchQuery)`
- `RankedSearchBackend::{Lexical, Hybrid, LexicalGraph, HybridGraph, Heuristic}`

This surface is intentionally separate from `ThoughtQuery`.

`ThoughtQuery` still decides **which** thoughts are eligible. Ranked search then decides **how those eligible thoughts are ordered**.

Current ranked-search behavior:

- `RankedSearchQuery.filter` uses the same deterministic semantics as `MentisDb::query`
- when `text` normalizes to a non-empty query, the backend is `lexical` or `hybrid` depending on whether a managed vector sidecar is active for the current handle
- lexical ranking scores indexed thought text plus agent metadata from the filtered candidate set
- when a managed vector sidecar is active for the current handle, ranked search blends lexical scoring with vector similarity and the backend becomes `hybrid`
- when `graph` is enabled alongside non-empty `text`, the backend becomes `lexical_graph` or `hybrid_graph` depending on whether vector scoring is available
- graph expansion starts from lexical seed hits, walks `refs` and typed `relations`, and can surface supporting context that did not lexically match
- `as_of` (RFC 3339 timestamp) filters to only relation edges that were valid at the given point in time, using each edge's `valid_at`/`invalid_at` temporal window — edges without temporal bounds are always included
- `scope` narrows results to thoughts tagged with a matching memory scope (`user`, `session`, or `agent`); omitted scope returns all
- when `text` is absent or blank, the backend falls back to `heuristic`
- heuristic ordering uses lightweight importance, confidence, and recency signals
- `total_candidates` counts the hits after filter application and ranked-signal gating, before final `limit` truncation
- each ranked hit includes `matched_terms` plus `match_sources` such as `content`, `tags`, `concepts`, `agent_id`, and `agent_registry`
- each ranked hit also includes a `vector` score component when semantic sidecars contribute to the ranking
- graph-expanded hits also expose `graph_distance`, `graph_seed_paths`, `graph_relation_kinds`, and `graph_path` provenance so callers can explain why a supporting thought surfaced
- grouped context delivery is available through `query_context_bundles`, which anchors supporting graph hits beneath lexical seeds in deterministic order

Lexical ranked example:

```rust,no_run
use mentisdb::{MentisDb, RankedSearchQuery, ThoughtQuery, ThoughtType};
use std::path::PathBuf;

# fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
let chain = MentisDb::open(&PathBuf::from("/tmp/tc_ranked"), "agent1", "Agent", None, None)?;

let ranked = RankedSearchQuery::new()
    .with_filter(
        ThoughtQuery::new()
            .with_types(vec![ThoughtType::Decision])
            .with_tags_any(["search"]),
    )
    .with_text("latency ranking")
    .with_limit(10);

let results = chain.query_ranked(&ranked);
assert!(matches!(
    results.backend,
    mentisdb::RankedSearchBackend::Lexical | mentisdb::RankedSearchBackend::Hybrid
));
# let _ = results;
# Ok(())
# }
```

Lexical + graph ranked example:

```rust,no_run
use mentisdb::{MentisDb, RankedSearchGraph, RankedSearchQuery, ThoughtQuery, ThoughtType};
use mentisdb::search::GraphExpansionMode;
use std::path::PathBuf;

# fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
let chain = MentisDb::open(&PathBuf::from("/tmp/tc_ranked"), "agent1", "Agent", None, None)?;

let ranked = RankedSearchQuery::new()
    .with_filter(
        ThoughtQuery::new()
            .with_types(vec![ThoughtType::Decision])
            .with_tags_any(["search"]),
    )
    .with_text("latency ranking")
    .with_graph(
        RankedSearchGraph::new()
            .with_max_depth(1)
            .with_mode(GraphExpansionMode::Bidirectional),
    )
    .with_limit(10);

let results = chain.query_ranked(&ranked);
# let _ = results;
# Ok(())
# }
```

Temporal and scoped ranked example:

```rust,no_run
use mentisdb::{MentisDb, MemoryScope, RankedSearchQuery, ThoughtQuery};
use std::path::PathBuf;

# fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
let chain = MentisDb::open(&PathBuf::from("/tmp/tc_ranked"), "agent1", "Agent", None, None)?;

let ranked = RankedSearchQuery::new()
    .with_filter(ThoughtQuery::new())
    .with_text("cache invalidation")
    .with_as_of("2025-06-01T00:00:00Z")
    .with_scope(MemoryScope::Session)
    .with_limit(10);

let results = chain.query_ranked(&ranked);
# let _ = results;
# Ok(())
# }
```

Vector-backed ranked example:

```rust,no_run
use mentisdb::{MentisDb, RankedSearchBackend, RankedSearchQuery};
use mentisdb::search::LocalTextEmbeddingProvider;
use std::path::PathBuf;

# fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
let mut chain = MentisDb::open_with_key(&PathBuf::from("/tmp/tc_ranked_vectors"), "semantic-ranked")?;
chain.append("planner", mentisdb::ThoughtType::Decision, "Tail latency ceiling for the Europe rollout.")?;

// Register the built-in local-text-v1 embedding sidecar so ranked search can
// blend lexical and semantic signals for the current chain handle.
chain.manage_vector_sidecar(LocalTextEmbeddingProvider::new())?;

let ranked = chain.query_ranked(&RankedSearchQuery::new().with_text("performance budget"));

assert_eq!(ranked.backend, RankedSearchBackend::Hybrid);
assert!(ranked.hits.iter().any(|hit| hit.score.vector > 0.0));
# Ok(())
# }
```

Grouped context example:

```rust,no_run
use mentisdb::{MentisDb, RankedSearchGraph, RankedSearchQuery, ThoughtQuery};
use mentisdb::search::GraphExpansionMode;
use std::path::PathBuf;

# fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
let chain = MentisDb::open(&PathBuf::from("/tmp/tc_ranked"), "agent1", "Agent", None, None)?;

let bundles = chain.query_context_bundles(
    &RankedSearchQuery::new()
        .with_filter(ThoughtQuery::new().with_tags_any(["search"]))
        .with_text("latency ranking")
        .with_graph(
            RankedSearchGraph::new()
                .with_mode(GraphExpansionMode::Bidirectional)
                .with_max_depth(2),
        )
        .with_limit(5),
);
# let _ = bundles;
# Ok(())
# }
```

Product rule:

- keep `ThoughtQuery` stable and explainable for append-order filtering
- evolve ranked search as a separate surface with its own benchmarks, tests, and transport layers
- treat registry-aware filtering and future transport exposure as additive work on top of the current crate API
- use `query_ranked` for flat ranked retrieval and `query_context_bundles` when the caller wants seed-anchored support context instead of one mixed list

The ranked-search benchmark `benches/search_ranked.rs` and evaluation tests in `tests/search_ranked_eval_tests.rs` are the guardrails for that additive surface.

### Search Scoring (0.8.1)

Starting in 0.8.1, ranked search uses six key improvements:

- **Porter stemming** — the lexical tokenizer stems all tokens before indexing and querying so word variants share a common root (e.g. `prefers`/`preferred`/`preferences` → `prefer`).
- **Smooth exponential vector-lexical fusion** — replaces the 0.8.0 step-function boosts with a continuous decay curve: `vector × (1 + 35 × exp(-lexical / 3.0))`. Pure-semantic matches get ~36× amplification; by lexical=3.0 the boost has decayed to ~12×; at lexical=6.0 it's additive. This eliminates discontinuities between tiers.
- **Session cohesion scoring** — thoughts within ±8 positions of a high-scoring lexical seed (score ≥ 3.0) receive a proximity boost up to 0.8, decaying linearly with distance. This surfaces evidence turns adjacent to the matching turn but sharing no lexical terms.
- **BM25 document-frequency cutoff** — terms appearing in >30% of documents (corpus ≥ 20 docs) are skipped during scoring. This filters non-discriminative entity names without blanket stopword removal.
- **Importance-weighted scoring** — replaces flat multipliers with a differential boost proportional to lexical score: `lexical × (importance - 0.5) × 0.3`. User-originated thoughts (importance ≈ 0.8) outrank verbose assistant responses (importance ≈ 0.2) in close BM25 races.
- **Graph expansion limits and relation boosts** — `MAX_GRAPH_SEEDS=20` bounds BFS cost; `ContinuesFrom` boost raised to 0.30; graph proximity 1.0/depth.

These changes took LongMemEval R@5 from 57.2% to 67.6% and LoCoMo 2-persona R@10 from 55.8% to 88.7%.

### Search Scoring (0.8.2)

Starting in 0.8.2, ranked search adds temporal, scoped, and dedup-aware features:

- **Temporal `as_of` point-in-time filtering** — `RankedSearchQuery::with_as_of(rfc3339)` restricts graph expansion to only relation edges whose `valid_at`/`invalid_at` window covers the given timestamp. Edges without temporal bounds are always included. This enables queries like "what did the agent know at the start of the sprint?"
- **Memory scope filtering via `scope` tag** — thoughts carry a `scope` field (`user`, `session`, or `agent`) stored as `scope:<value>` tags. `RankedSearchQuery::with_scope(MemoryScope::Session)` narrows results to session-scoped memories only. Omitting scope returns thoughts from all scopes.
- **Auto-dedup with `Supersedes` relations** — when `MENTISDB_DEDUP_THRESHOLD` is set (recommended `0.85` for long-lived agent chains; **off** by default), appending a thought whose content is sufficiently similar (Jaccard ≥ threshold) to a recent thought automatically emits a `Supersedes` relation to that prior thought. The prior thought remains on disk for audit; its id enters the invalidation set for default search exclusion.
- **`invalidated_thought_ids` for O(1) superseded exclusion** — thoughts targeted by `Supersedes`, `Corrects`, or `Invalidates` are excluded from default `query`, ranked search, context bundles, recent context, and related retrieval. Pass `include_invalidated=true` (or `ThoughtQuery::with_include_invalidated(true)`) for audit. Point-in-time `as_of` still surfaces thoughts that were valid at that timestamp. The set only fills when those edges exist (agent-written and/or auto-dedup).

### Search Scoring (0.8.7)

Starting in 0.8.7, ranked search adds:

- **Entity type filtering** — thoughts can carry an optional `entity_type` label (e.g. "bug_report", "architecture_decision", "retrospective"). The `ThoughtQuery` accepts `entity_type` as a filter, and the dashboard exposes an entity_type text filter in the explorer. Entity types are auto-observed per chain and persisted in a `chain_key-entity-types.json` sidecar.

### Search Scoring (0.8.6)

Starting in 0.8.6, ranked search adds three features:

- **Irregular verb lemma expansion** — the query tokenizer maps irregular past-tense verbs to their base form (e.g. "went" → "go", "gave" → "give", "ran" → "run"). About 170 mappings. Indexed content is not modified — expansion is query-time only.
- **Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)** — an opt-in reranking pass. When `enable_reranking=true` is set on a ranked search query, the engine produces separate lexical-only, vector-only, and graph-only rankings over the top `rerank_k` candidates (default 50), merges them via `1/(k + rank)` with `k=60`, and replaces the additive total with the RRF total plus non-rankable signal adjustments. Use when lexical and vector signals disagree on top candidates.
- **Per-field BM25 DF cutoffs** — `Bm25DfCutoffs` on `LexicalQuery` allows configuring separate document-frequency cutoff ratios per field (content, tags, concepts, agent_id, agent_registry). Terms whose global DF exceeds the cutoff for a given field are skipped for that field only. Default cutoffs match the original behavior (content=0.30, tags=0.30, concepts=0.30, agent_id=0.70, agent_registry=0.60).

### Search Scoring (after 0.9.9)

The post-0.9.9 ranked-search validation run used real embeddings plus automatic thesaurus expansion on the full LoCoMo-10P benchmark:

- **LoCoMo-10P overall R@10: 72.6%** (1436 / 1977 queries)
- **Single-hop R@10: 76.8%** (1193 / 1554 queries)
- **Multi-hop R@10: 57.4%** (243 / 423 queries)
- **Weak-vector smoke baseline: 44.9% R@10**, so the validated pipeline improved recall by 27.7 percentage points.
- **Evaluation throughput: 6 seconds for 1977 queries** (~317 queries/second).
- **Vector sidecar: `fastembed-all-minilm-l6-v2`**, about 28 MB with 5882 indexed thoughts.

The run applied the built-in thesaurus transparently on every `ranked_search` call and matches the whitepaper target of about 72% overall LoCoMo-10P R@10.

### Vector Sidecars

MentisDB now exposes an additive Phase 3 vector sidecar surface for direct crate use:

- `search::EmbeddingProvider`
- `search::EmbeddingMetadata`
- `search::VectorSidecar`
- `VectorSearchQuery`
- `MentisDb::vector_sidecar_path(&EmbeddingMetadata)`
- `MentisDb::load_vector_sidecar(&EmbeddingMetadata)`
- `MentisDb::vector_sidecar_freshness(&VectorSidecar, &EmbeddingMetadata)`
- `MentisDb::rebuild_vector_sidecar(&provider)`
- `MentisDb::manage_vector_sidecar(provider)`
- `MentisDb::unmanage_vector_sidecar(&EmbeddingMetadata)`
- `MentisDb::managed_vector_sidecars()`
- `MentisDb::apply_persisted_managed_vector_sidecars()`
- `MentisDb::managed_vector_sidecar_statuses()`
- `MentisDb::set_managed_vector_sidecar_enabled(kind, enabled)`
- `MentisDb::sync_managed_vector_sidecar_now(kind)`
- `MentisDb::rebuild_managed_vector_sidecar_from_scratch(kind)`
- `MentisDb::query_vector(&provider, &VectorSearchQuery)`

Contract:

- embeddings remain optional, and MentisDB still works with no vector dependencies at all
- vector state lives in a rebuildable sidecar, never in the canonical append-only chain
- vector sidecars are separated by `chain_key`, `thought_id`, `thought_hash`, `model_id`, embedding dimension, and embedding version
- changing the embedding model or version invalidates old vector state instead of silently mixing incompatible embeddings
- callers can opt one embedding space into append-time synchronization on a live handle by registering a managed vector sidecar provider
- vector hits surface whether they came from a `Fresh` or stale sidecar
- deleting or corrupting the sidecar degrades only vector retrieval; plain chain reads, appends, and lexical/graph search still work
- since 0.10.6, each append writes one integrity-chained WAL record beside the JSON snapshot (`*.json.wal`, magic `MDBVWAL1`). Load replays the WAL after verifying the snapshot digest. The snapshot is compacted and the WAL removed every 32 records. Older binaries that only read JSON treat a sidecar with a pending WAL as stale and rebuild.

Operational flow:

- rebuild a sidecar explicitly for one provider and chain
- or register that provider as a managed vector sidecar and keep it fresh on future appends for that open handle
- load or query that sidecar later with the same embedding metadata
- if the chain head changes, the sidecar becomes stale and results report that freshness state until the sidecar is rebuilt

### `mentisdb` Default Vector Sidecar

`mentisdb` now applies a persisted managed-vector setting every time it opens a chain.

- by default each chain gets the built-in FastEmbed MiniLM embedding provider (`fastembed-minilm`), which runs locally via ONNX with no cloud dependencies. The legacy `local-text-v1` provider is also available.
- the daemon keeps that sidecar synchronized on append unless the user disables auto-sync for that chain
- ranked search in the daemon and dashboard now uses that managed sidecar transparently, blending lexical, graph, and vector signals whenever it is enabled and available
- the web dashboard exposes per-chain controls to:
  - enable or disable append-time auto-sync
  - sync the sidecar to the latest chain state without changing the enable/disable setting
  - rebuild the sidecar from scratch after an explicit confirmation that the previous file will be deleted and recreated
- if auto-sync is disabled, new thoughts can make the sidecar stale until the user syncs or rebuilds it

### HNSW approximate-nearest-neighbor vector backend

By default MentisDB uses an exact cosine scan over the managed vector sidecar.
Once the sidecar reaches `MENTISDB_HNSW_THRESHOLD` vectors (default 50,000) the
backend automatically switches to an **HNSW** approximate graph for that
sidecar. The same `VectorSearchBackend` trait powers both implementations, so
public APIs and hybrid/ranked search results stay the same:

- small corpora keep the deterministic exact backend
- large corpora get sub-linear approximate search with no query change
- `MENTISDB_HNSW_EF_CONSTRUCTION` and `MENTISDB_HNSW_EF_SEARCH` tune accuracy
  versus latency
- `MENTISDB_HNSW_BACKGROUND_BUILD` (default true) builds the graph off-thread
  while the daemon keeps answering queries

End users see lower latency transparently. The HNSW backend is always compiled
in since 0.10.4.49.

### REST Lexical Search

The daemon also exposes the Phase 1 ranked lexical surface over REST at `POST /v1/lexical-search`.

This is the right endpoint when you want lexicographical/lexical text ranking only, with simple score and match provenance fields.

Request shape:

```json
{
  "chain_key": "mentisdb",
  "text": "latency ranking",
  "agent_ids": ["planner"],
  "thought_types": ["Decision"],
  "offset": 0,
  "limit": 10
}
```

Example response:

```json
{
  "total": 1,
  "results": [
    {
      "thought": {
        "index": 42,
        "agent_id": "planner",
        "content": "Latency budget for the Europe rollout."
      },
      "score": 2.91,
      "matched_terms": ["latency", "ranking"],
      "match_sources": ["content", "tags", "agent_registry"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Phase 4 Transport Contract (Ranked + Bundles)

Phase 4 transport work keeps plain `POST /v1/search` and `POST /v1/lexical-search`
compatibility and adds two additive endpoints:

- `POST /v1/ranked-search` for flat ranked retrieval
- `POST /v1/context-bundles` for seed-anchored grouped support context

Example `POST /v1/ranked-search` request:

```json
{
  "chain_key": "mentisdb",
  "text": "performance budget",
  "thought_types": ["Decision"],
  "limit": 10
}
```

When a managed vector sidecar such as the built-in `fastembed-minilm` provider is active for that chain, the ranked backend becomes `hybrid` or `hybrid_graph` and the response includes a non-zero `score.vector` component for semantic-only or semantic-boosted hits.

Ranked response contract fields:

- `backend`
- `results[].score.{lexical,vector,graph,relation,seed_support,importance,confidence,recency,session_cohesion,rrf,total}`
- `results[].matched_terms`
- `results[].match_sources`
- `results[].graph_distance`
- `results[].graph_seed_paths`
- `results[].graph_relation_kinds`
- `results[].graph_path`
- `results[].chain_key` (present when searching branch chains with ancestor results)

Context-bundle response contract fields:

- `total_bundles`
- `consumed_hits`
- `bundles[].seed.{locator,lexical_score,matched_terms,thought}`
- `bundles[].support[].{locator,thought,depth,seed_path_count,relation_kinds,path}`

MCP transport mirrors this split with additive tools:

- `mentisdb_ranked_search`
- `mentisdb_context_bundles`

Acceptance coverage for these transport contracts lives in:

- `tests/search_transport_contract_tests.rs`

Response shape:

```json
{
  "total": 2,
  "results": [
    {
      "thought": { "index": 42, "agent_id": "planner", "content": "..." },
      "score": {
        "lexical": 2.91,
        "vector": 0.27,
        "graph": 0.18,
        "relation": 0.05,
        "seed_support": 0.0,
        "importance": 0.0,
        "confidence": 0.0,
        "recency": 0.0,
        "total": 3.14
      },
      "matched_terms": ["latency", "ranking"],
      "match_sources": ["content", "tags", "agent_registry"]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Web Dashboard

The daemon includes an embedded browser UI at:

```text
https://127.0.0.1:9475/dashboard
```

The dashboard is served over HTTPS with the same self-signed certificate used by
the HTTPS MCP and REST surfaces.

Dashboard capabilities:

- live chain listing with thought, agent, and storage-size counts
- thought exploration with grouped ThoughtType filters, refs, and typed relations
- chain-scoped ranked search with text and live-agent filters
- grouped context bundles for seed-anchored supporting search context
- ranked result inspection in the thought modal, including score breakdowns, matched terms, graph distance, relation kinds, and bundle support preview
- per-chain vector sidecar inspection plus enable/disable, sync, and rebuild controls
- agent detail management for display name, description, owner, status, and signing keys
- latest agent-thought browsing without restarting the daemon after new thoughts are appended
- chain import from `MEMORY.md`
- cross-chain agent-memory copy with agent metadata preserved on the target chain
- skill browsing, summary counts (total / active / revoked / deprecated), diffing, editing into new immutable versions, deprecation, revocation, and permanent delete of revoked skills
- Settings tab to view and edit all `MENTISDB_*` environment variables with live apply, reset-to-default, and `.env` persistence

Protect the dashboard with `MENTISDB_DASHBOARD_PIN` whenever the daemon is reachable
outside localhost.

---

## TLS Certificates

The HTTPS MCP and REST servers and the web dashboard all serve a single
self-signed certificate that the daemon auto-generates on first startup at
`<MENTISDB_DIR>/tls/cert.pem` (and `key.pem`). The standard SAN set always
includes `my.mentisdb.com` (DNS), `localhost` (DNS), `127.0.0.1` (IP), every
unicast IP on every host interface, plus `MENTISDB_BIND_HOST` when it is a DNS
name — that is enough for local-only use and for connecting to the daemon by
its public DNS name.

For remote / VPS / custom-hostname setups you may need to add a SAN that the
daemon cannot infer on its own. The `mentisdb cert` subcommand mints a fresh
self-signed certificate with an extra SAN of your choice, makes it the active
cert on disk, and updates the local `.env` so the next daemon start serves the
new cert automatically.

```bash
# 1. Standard cert into the default location
#    (~/.cloudllm/mentisdb/tls/ and updates ./.env)
mentisdb cert

# 2. Add a public VPS IP as a SAN so the cert is valid for that IP
mentisdb cert 192.0.2.10

# 3. Add a custom DNS hostname
mentisdb cert vps.example.com

# 4. Regenerate an existing cert (e.g. after adding a new IP to the box)
mentisdb cert 192.0.2.10 --force

# 5. Reset to factory defaults: delete existing cert/key, then generate fresh
mentisdb cert --reset

# 6. Write to a non-default directory and update a custom .env file
mentisdb cert 192.0.2.10 \
    --out-dir /etc/mentisdb/tls \
    --env-file /etc/mentisdb/mentisdb.env

# 7. Print the values without touching any .env (for ephemeral hosts)
mentisdb cert --no-env-update
```

### Options

| Argument / Flag   | Description |
|---|---|
| `<ip-or-domain>`   | Optional IP literal or DNS hostname to add as a SAN. IPv4 and IPv6 literals become IP SANs; everything else becomes a DNS SAN. Omit to mint a cert with only the standard SAN set. |
| `--force`          | Overwrite an existing `cert.pem` / `key.pem` on disk. Without this flag the command refuses to clobber a pre-existing cert so operators do not accidentally invalidate an already-trusted one. |
| `--reset`          | Delete existing `cert.pem` / `key.pem` files first, then generate a fresh factory-default certificate. Implies `--force`. |
| `--out-dir <path>` | Directory to write `cert.pem` and `key.pem` into. Defaults to the directory of `MENTISDB_TLS_CERT` (or `<MENTISDB_DIR>/tls/`). |
| `--env-file <path>`| Path to the `.env` file to update with the new cert paths. Defaults to `./.env`. |
| `--no-env-update`  | Skip updating the `.env` file. The cert is still minted, the SAN list and SHA-256 fingerprint are still printed, and the command prints the `export MENTISDB_TLS_CERT=...` lines for you to paste into a shell rc. |

### When the new cert takes effect

The new `cert.pem` and `key.pem` are written immediately and `MENTISDB_TLS_CERT` /
`MENTISDB_TLS_KEY` are updated on disk. The running daemon keeps using the cert
it loaded at startup, so **restart the daemon** (`Ctrl-C` in the TUI or stop
the background process) for the new cert to be served on the next HTTPS
request. Subsequent calls to `mentisdb cert` without `--force` reuse the
existing cert so the in-flight HTTPS fingerprint stays stable across restarts.

Cross-check the new cert from any machine with:

```bash
openssl s_client -connect <host>:9473 -showcerts </dev/null 2>/dev/null \
    | openssl x509 -fingerprint -sha256 -noout
```

…then compare against the `SHA-256 fingerprint:` line that `mentisdb cert`
prints. If they match, the running daemon is serving the cert you just minted.

### When the auto-generated SAN set is not enough

The default SAN set covers local and most remote setups. The `mentisdb cert`
subcommand is the right tool when:

- You connect to the daemon over a remote / VPS IP (`https://<vps-ip>:9473`) and
  the IP is not in the SAN set.
- You use a custom hostname (`vps.example.com`) and want the cert to be valid
  for that name.
- You added a new network interface or new IP to the host and need the cert
  to cover the new IP.
- You rotated the private key for security reasons and want a new cert + key
  pair.
- You migrated the daemon to a new machine and the old cert (still on the old
  box) needs to be regenerated locally.

For all other situations the auto-generated cert is fine — there is no
periodic renewal, no expiry alerts, and the daemon reuses the existing
material across restarts unless you delete it or pass `--force`.

---

## Backup and Restore

MentisDB includes built-in backup and restore commands in the `mentisdb` CLI.

### Create a backup

```bash
# Default: platform MENTISDB_DIR → ./mentisdb-YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS.mentis
mentisdb backup

# Custom output path
mentisdb backup -o /backups/mentisdb-2026-04-14.mentis

# Include TLS certificates
mentisdb backup --include-tls

# Full example
mentisdb backup --dir ~/.cloudllm/mentisdb -o /backups/mentisdb-2026-04-14.mentis --include-tls
```

When the daemon is running, `backup` calls `POST /v1/admin/flush` before reading files to ensure a consistent snapshot even with `MENTISDB_AUTO_FLUSH=false`. If the daemon is not running, files are captured as-is.

### Restore a backup

The daemon must be stopped before restoring. If `mentisdb` is detected running, the restore aborts with a message to stop the daemon first.

```bash
# Idempotent restore (preserves existing files)
mentisdb restore /backups/mentisdb-2026-04-14.mentis

# Restore to a specific directory
mentisdb restore /backups/mentisdb-2026-04-14.mentis --dir ~/.cloudllm/mentisdb

# Allow same-path chain files to be replaced when a safe suffix merge is not possible
mentisdb restore /backups/mentisdb-2026-04-14.mentis --overwrite

# Skip interactive confirmation prompts while keeping the default preserve/merge behavior
mentisdb restore /backups/mentisdb-2026-04-14.mentis --yes
```

Restore is **idempotent by default**. When the target directory is empty,
MentisDB imports the full instance, including registry, chains, skills,
webhooks, and optional TLS files. When the target already contains a MentisDB
instance, restore preserves the local `mentisdb-registry.json` and treats the
backup registry as a hint: new chains are appended to the local registry with
local storage paths, compatible same-key chains append only the verified missing
suffix, older backups are ignored, and same-name chains with different genesis
are imported under a non-conflicting `-imported` chain key. Existing global files
such as skills and webhooks are preserved unless they are absent locally.

`--overwrite` no longer means "replace the whole instance." It only allows
same-path chain files to be replaced when the chain cannot be safely merged and
the operator explicitly requested overwrite. The local registry is still merged
and preserved.

### Archive format

A backup is a `.mentis` ZIP archive containing:
- `mentisdb.manifest.json` — SHA-256 checksums and metadata
- `*.tcbin` — binary chain storage
- `*.agents.json` — per-chain agent registries
- `*.entity-types.json` — per-chain entity type definitions
- `*.vectors.*.json` — vector search sidecars
- `mentisdb-registry.json` — global chain registry
- `mentisdb-skills.bin` — skill registry (if present)
- `mentisdb-webhooks.json` — webhook registrations (if present)
- `tls/` — TLS certificates and keys (opt-in via `--include-tls`)

Every file is verified by SHA-256 before restore writes anything to disk. A corrupted archive aborts with an error and leaves the target directory untouched.

### REST flush endpoint

The flush operation is also available as a standalone REST endpoint:

```bash
POST http://127.0.0.1:9472/v1/admin/flush
```

Returns `{"status": "flushed"}` on success. Iterates all open chains and calls `flush()` on each adapter, blocking until all writes are durable.

The detailed request and response shapes for the MCP surface live in
[`MENTISDB_MCP.md`](../MENTISDB_MCP.md). The REST equivalents live in
[`MENTISDB_REST.md`](../MENTISDB_REST.md).

## Thought Lookup And Traversal

MentisDB distinguishes three different read patterns:

- `head` means the newest thought at the current tip of the append-only chain
- `genesis` means the very first thought in the chain
- traversal means sequential browsing by append order, forward or backward, in chunks

That traversal model is deliberately different from graph/context traversal through `refs` and typed relations. Graph traversal answers "what is connected to this thought?" Sequential traversal answers "what came before or after this thought in the ledger?"

Lookup and traversal support:

- direct thought lookup by `id`, `hash`, or `index`
- logical `genesis` and `head` anchors
- `forward` and `backward` traversal directions
- `include_anchor` control for inclusive vs exclusive paging
- chunked pagination, including `chunk_size = 1` for next/previous behavior
- optional filters reused from thought search, such as agent identity, thought type, role, tags, concepts, text, importance, confidence, and time windows
- numeric time windows expressed as `start + delta` with `seconds` or `milliseconds` units for MCP/REST callers

---

## Skill Registry

MentisDB includes a versioned skill registry stored alongside chain data in a binary file. Skills are ingested through adapters:

- Markdown -> `SkillDocument`
- JSON -> `SkillDocument`
- `SkillDocument` -> Markdown
- `SkillDocument` -> JSON

Each uploaded skill version records:

- registry file version
- skill schema version
- upload timestamp
- responsible `agent_id`
- optional agent display name and owner from the MentisDB agent registry
- source format
- integrity hash

Uploaders must already exist in the agent registry for the referenced chain. Reusing an existing `skill_id` creates a new immutable version; it does not overwrite history. The dashboard can create those new versions from either the Skills table or a skill detail page while preserving the original uploader identity and source format.

`read_skill` responses include explicit safety warnings because `SKILL.md` content can be malicious. Treat every skill as advisory until provenance, trust, and requested capabilities are validated.

### Skill Lifecycle

The registry is append-only for versions. Status changes do not rewrite history:

| Action | Keeps versions? | Same `skill_id` reusable? | Surfaces |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Deprecate** | Yes (audit + still readable) | No — upload creates another version | REST `POST /v1/skills/deprecate`, MCP `mentisdb_deprecate_skill`, dashboard Deprecate |
| **Revoke** | Yes (audit row; agents should refuse to execute) | No | REST `POST /v1/skills/revoke`, MCP `mentisdb_revoke_skill`, dashboard Revoke |
| **Delete** | No — every version is removed from `mentisdb-skills.bin` | Yes — the id can be uploaded again as `Active` | REST `POST /v1/skills/delete`, MCP `mentisdb_delete_skill`, dashboard `DELETE /dashboard/api/skills/{id}` |

Revoke when you need a forensic trail. Delete when the skill should vanish (wrong upload, junk, or you want the slug back). Crate, REST, and MCP delete any existing `skill_id` regardless of status. The dashboard UI follows the bearer-token pattern: **Revoke** on active/deprecated rows, then **Delete** / **Delete Permanently** on revoked list rows and the skill-detail pane (type the skill id to confirm).

`SkillRegistry::counts()` and the Skills page summary bar report `total` / `active` / `revoked` / `deprecated`. Permanently deleted skills are absent and are not counted.

### Skill Versioning

Each upload to an existing `skill_id` creates a new immutable version rather than overwriting history:

- The first upload stores the full content (`SkillVersionContent::Full`).
- Subsequent uploads store a unified diff patch against the previous version
  (`SkillVersionContent::Delta`), keeping storage efficient for iteratively improved skills.
- Each version receives a monotone `version_number` (0-based, assigned in append order).
- Pass a `version_id` to `read_skill` / `mentisdb_read_skill` to retrieve any historical version.
  The system reconstructs it by replaying patches forward from version 0.
- `skill_versions` / `mentisdb_skill_versions` lists all versions with their ids, numbers, and timestamps.

### Signed Skill Uploads

Agents that have registered Ed25519 public keys in the agent registry must sign their uploads.

Required fields when the uploading agent has active keys:

- `signing_key_id` — the `key_id` registered via `POST /v1/agents/keys` or `mentisdb_add_agent_key`
- `skill_signature` — 64-byte Ed25519 signature over the raw skill content bytes

Agents without registered public keys may upload without signatures.

Upload flow for signing agents:

1. Register a public key:
   ```bash
   POST /v1/agents/keys   { agent_id, key_id, algorithm: "ed25519", public_key_bytes }
   ```
   or via MCP: `mentisdb_add_agent_key`
2. Sign the raw content bytes with the corresponding private key (Ed25519).
3. Include `signing_key_id` and `skill_signature` in the upload request:
   ```bash
   POST /v1/skills/upload   { agent_id, skill_id, content, signing_key_id, skill_signature }
   ```
   or via MCP: `mentisdb_upload_skill` with the same fields.

## Setup Scenarios

### Claude Desktop

1. **Recommended (stdio mode)** — just run `mentisdb setup claude-desktop` and
   it will write the stdio config. No daemon needed, no Node.js, no mcp-remote.
   The stdio process auto-detects and proxies to a running daemon, or launches
   one in the background if none is found.
2. **Alternative (HTTP via mcp-remote)** — requires Node.js >= 20 and
   `npm install -g mcp-remote`. Run `mentisdb` as a daemon first, then
   configure Claude Desktop to use `mcp-remote` as a bridge to the HTTPS
   endpoint.

### Claude Code

1. Start the server: `mentisdb run`
2. Add the MCP server:
   ```bash
   claude mcp add --transport http mentisdb http://127.0.0.1:9471
   ```
3. Or run `mentisdb setup claude-code` to auto-configure

### OpenCode

1. Start the server: `mentisdb run`
2. Add the MCP server:
   ```bash
   opencode mcp add mentisdb http://127.0.0.1:9471
   ```

### Codex

```bash
codex mcp add mentisdb --url http://127.0.0.1:9471
```

### Qwen Code

```bash
qwen mcp add --transport http mentisdb http://127.0.0.1:9471
```

---

## Using With MCP Clients

`mentisdb` exposes both:

- a standard streamable HTTP MCP endpoint at `POST /`
- a Server-Sent Events (SSE) endpoint at `GET /` returning `text/event-stream` with
  live MCP protocol events — every tool call result and error is broadcast in real time
- the legacy CloudLLM-compatible MCP endpoints at `POST /tools/list` and
  `POST /tools/execute`

That means you can:

- use native MCP clients such as Codex and Claude Code against `http://127.0.0.1:9471`
- keep using direct HTTP calls or `cloudllm`'s MCP compatibility layer when needed

### Bearer Token Access For Remote MCP Servers

If a MentisDB daemon is reachable beyond your own machine, enable bearer-token
access before adding it to remote MCP clients:

```bash
MENTISDB_BIND_HOST=0.0.0.0 \
MENTISDB_BEARER_TOKEN_ACCESS=true \
MENTISDB_DASHBOARD_PIN=change-me \
mentisdb
```

Tokens are managed by alias. The raw token is printed once at creation time;
MentisDB stores only a SHA-256 hash plus metadata such as scope, creation time,
revocation time, and last successful use.

Create a global admin token:

```bash
mentisdb bearertoken create --global admin-laptop
```

Create a token limited to one or more chains:

```bash
mentisdb bearertoken create --chain alice alice-agent
mentisdb bearertoken create bob-agent --chain bob
mentisdb bearertoken create team-agent --chain alice --chain shared
```

List and revoke tokens:

```bash
mentisdb bearertoken list
mentisdb bearertoken list --chain alice
mentisdb bearertoken list --chain alice --chain shared
mentisdb bearertoken remove alice-agent
```

Global tokens can call every MCP tool and access every chain. Chain-scoped tokens
can call tools for any chain in their configured set, including requests that
omit `chain_key` when the daemon default chain is in their scope. Tools that
expose server-wide state, such as `mentisdb_list_chains`, require a global token.

#### Bearer Token MCP Client Config Examples

For every remote MCP harness, the important part is the same:

```http
Authorization: Bearer mentisdb_replace_me
```

Use a global token for administrators. Use a chain-scoped or multi-chain token
for agents that should only see specific memory chains.

**Codex** (`~/.codex/config.toml`):

```toml
[mcp_servers.mentisdb]
url = "https://my.mentisdb.com:9473"
http_headers = { Authorization = "Bearer mentisdb_replace_me" }
```

**Claude Code**:

```bash
claude mcp add-json mentisdb \
  '{"type":"http","url":"https://my.mentisdb.com:9473","headers":{"Authorization":"Bearer mentisdb_replace_me"}}' \
  --scope user
```

**Qwen Code**:

```bash
qwen mcp add --scope user --transport http mentisdb https://my.mentisdb.com:9473 \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer mentisdb_replace_me"
```

Or edit `~/.qwen/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mentisdb": {
      "httpUrl": "https://my.mentisdb.com:9473",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer mentisdb_replace_me"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**GitHub Copilot CLI** (`~/.copilot/mcp-config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mentisdb": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://my.mentisdb.com:9473",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer mentisdb_replace_me"
      },
      "tools": ["*"]
    }
  }
}
```

**VS Code + Copilot** (`.vscode/mcp.json` or your user `mcp.json`):

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "mentisdb": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://my.mentisdb.com:9473",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer mentisdb_replace_me"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**OpenCode** (`~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`):

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "mentisdb": {
      "type": "remote",
      "url": "https://my.mentisdb.com:9473",
      "enabled": true,
      "oauth": false,
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer mentisdb_replace_me"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Hermes Agent** (`~/.hermes/config.yaml`):

```yaml
mcp_servers:
  mentisdb:
    url: "https://my.mentisdb.com:9473"
    headers:
      Authorization: "Bearer mentisdb_replace_me"
```

You can also manage tokens in the dashboard Settings screen: enter an alias,
choose Global or Chains, select one or more chains for scoped tokens, create the
token, and revoke active tokens from the table. The bearer-token table is
intentionally metadata-only; future versions can extend those records with
per-token usage counters without changing how clients authenticate.

### Codex

Codex CLI expects a streamable HTTP MCP server when you use `--url`:

```bash
codex mcp add mentisdb --url http://127.0.0.1:9471
```

Useful follow-up commands:

```bash
codex mcp list
codex mcp get mentisdb
```

This connects Codex to the daemon's standard MCP root endpoint.

### Qwen Code

Qwen Code uses the same HTTP MCP transport model:

```bash
qwen mcp add --transport http mentisdb http://127.0.0.1:9471
```

Useful follow-up commands:

```bash
qwen mcp list
```

For user-scoped configuration:

```bash
qwen mcp add --scope user --transport http mentisdb http://127.0.0.1:9471
```

### Claude for Desktop

Claude for Desktop supports two connection modes: **stdio** (recommended) and
**HTTP via mcp-remote**.

#### Option 1: Stdio mode (recommended)

Claude Desktop spawns `mentisdb --mode stdio` as a subprocess. The stdio
process automatically detects if a daemon is already running — if so, it acts
as a lightweight proxy to the live daemon; if not, it launches one in the
background. This means all Claude Desktop sessions share the same live chain
cache with zero configuration.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mentisdb": {
      "command": "mentisdb",
      "args": ["--mode", "stdio"]
    }
  }
}
```

This is the simplest setup — no Node.js, no mcp-remote, no TLS config. Just
point Claude Desktop at the `mentisdb` binary.

#### Option 2: HTTP via mcp-remote

If you prefer the HTTP transport (e.g. for a remote daemon), use the
`mcp-remote` bridge. This requires [Node.js >= 20](https://nodejs.org/) and the
[`mcp-remote`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mcp-remote) npm package.

The recommended setup path is automatic:

```bash
mentisdb setup claude-desktop
```

This command:

- checks for Node.js >= 20 and `mcp-remote` on PATH
- installs `mcp-remote` via `npm` if missing
- writes `claude_desktop_config.json` with the correct absolute paths to `node`
  and `mcp-remote` so the desktop app always uses the right Node version
- sets `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0` for self-signed certificate support

To set it up manually instead:

**Step 1 — Install prerequisites** (Node.js >= 20 required):

```bash
npm install -g mcp-remote
```

**Step 2 — Edit the config file** (location by OS):

| OS      | Path |
|---------|------|
| macOS   | `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` |
| Linux   | `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` |

The config should use the `node` binary as the command and pass the
`mcp-remote` script path as the first argument. This avoids the shebang
resolution issue where `mcp-remote`'s `#!/usr/bin/env node` may pick an older
Node.js version on systems with multiple Node installs (e.g. nvm).

**macOS (with nvm):**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mentisdb": {
      "command": "/Users/you/.nvm/versions/node/v22.18.0/bin/node",
      "args": ["/Users/you/.nvm/versions/node/v22.18.0/bin/mcp-remote", "https://my.mentisdb.com:9473"],
      "env": { "NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED": "0" }
    }
  }
}
```

**macOS (with Homebrew Node):**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mentisdb": {
      "command": "/opt/homebrew/bin/node",
      "args": ["/opt/homebrew/bin/mcp-remote", "https://my.mentisdb.com:9473"],
      "env": { "NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED": "0" }
    }
  }
}
```

**Windows:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mentisdb": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["mcp-remote", "https://my.mentisdb.com:9473"],
      "env": { "NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED": "0" }
    }
  }
}
```

Use `which mcp-remote` and `which node` to confirm the binary paths on your
machine. **Both must point to the same Node.js installation (>= 20).**

**Linux:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mentisdb": {
      "command": "/usr/local/bin/node",
      "args": ["/usr/local/bin/mcp-remote", "https://my.mentisdb.com:9473"],
      "env": { "NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED": "0" }
    }
  }
}
```

> **Why `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED: "0"`?**  
> MentisDB ships with a self-signed TLS certificate. Node.js rejects self-signed
> certs by default, which causes `mcp-remote` to disconnect immediately after the
> MCP `initialize` handshake. This env var disables that check for the
> `mcp-remote` process only. As an alternative, trust the certificate at the OS
> level (`sudo security add-trusted-cert` on macOS) and remove the `env` block.
>
> **Why use `node` as the command instead of `mcp-remote` directly?**  
> The `mcp-remote` shell script uses `#!/usr/bin/env node` as its shebang. On
> systems with multiple Node.js versions (e.g. managed by nvm), the shebang may
> resolve to an older Node that doesn't support `mcp-remote`'s dependencies
> (which require Node >= 20). Using the explicit `node` path as the command
> bypasses the shebang entirely and guarantees the correct Node version is used.

Restart Claude for Desktop after saving the config file.

### Stdio Mode — How It Works

`mentisdb --mode stdio` reads JSON-RPC 2.0 from stdin and writes responses to
stdout. It is designed for MCP clients that spawn subprocesses (Claude Desktop,
Cursor, etc.).

**Smart daemon detection**: When the stdio process starts, it checks if a
daemon is already running on the configured MCP port (`127.0.0.1:9471` by
default) via the health endpoint.

- **Daemon running** → the stdio process acts as a lightweight proxy, forwarding
  `tools/list` and `tools/call` requests to the daemon's HTTP MCP endpoints.
  `initialize`, `ping`, and `resources/read` are handled locally. All clients
  share the same live in-memory chain cache.
- **No daemon** → the stdio process launches the daemon in the background
  (`nohup` on Unix, `start /B` on Windows) with `--mode http --headless`, waits
  for it to become responsive, then proxies. The daemon outlives the stdio
  process without starting the TUI on a null stdin.
- **Daemon launch fails** → falls back to local mode, creating its own
  `MentisDbService` instance (state shared only via disk files).

This means you never need to manually start the daemon — Claude Desktop, Cursor,
or any MCP client can just spawn `mentisdb --mode stdio` and everything works.

The daemon address is configurable via `MENTISDB_BIND_HOST` and
`MENTISDB_MCP_PORT` environment variables, so the stdio process will detect and
proxy to a daemon on a non-standard port.

### Claude Code

Claude Code supports MCP servers through its `claude mcp` commands and
project/user MCP config. For a remote HTTP MCP server, the configuration shape
is transport-based:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http mentisdb http://127.0.0.1:9471
```

Useful follow-up commands:

```bash
claude mcp list
claude mcp get mentisdb
```

`mentisdb setup claude-code` merges the MCP server entry into
`~/.claude.json` (or `%USERPROFILE%\.claude.json` on Windows), preserving your
existing Claude Code settings. The older `~/.claude/mcp/mentisdb.json` path is
treated as a legacy companion file, not the canonical config target. The
MentisDB HTTP MCP block it writes looks like this:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mentisdb": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:9471"
    }
  }
}
```

Important:

- `/mcp` inside Claude Code is mainly for managing or authenticating MCP
  servers that are already configured
- the server itself must already be running at the configured URL

### GitHub Copilot CLI

GitHub Copilot CLI can also connect to `mentisdb` as a remote HTTP MCP
server.

From interactive mode:

1. Run `/mcp add`
2. Set `Server Name` to `mentisdb`
3. Set `Server Type` to `HTTP`
4. Set `URL` to `http://127.0.0.1:9471`
5. Leave headers empty unless you add auth later
6. Save the config

You can also configure it manually in `~/.copilot/mcp-config.json` (or
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/copilot/mcp-config.json` when `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is set):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mentisdb": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:9471",
      "headers": {},
      "tools": ["*"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Python Client

`pymentisdb` is the official Python client for MentisDB.

### Install

```bash
pip install pymentisdb
pip install pymentisdb[langchain]  # with LangChain integration
```

### Basic Example

```python
from pymentisdb import MentisDbClient, ThoughtType

client = MentisDbClient()  # defaults to http://127.0.0.1:9472

# Append a thought
thought = client.append_thought(
    thought_type=ThoughtType.INSIGHT,
    content="Rate limiting is the real bottleneck."
)

# Ranked search
results = client.ranked_search(text="performance optimization")
for hit in results.results:
    print(f"[{hit.score.total:.3f}] {hit.thought.content}")

# Context bundles
bundles = client.context_bundles(text="cache invalidation", limit=5)
```

### LangChain Integration

```python
from pymentisdb import MentisDbMemory

memory = MentisDbMemory(chain_key="my-project", agent_id="assistant")

llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4")
chain = llm.with_memory(memory)  # LangChain 0.3+
```

See the [full pymentisdb guide](docs/pymentisdb-python-client.html) for complete API reference.

## LLM-Extracted Memories

MentisDB can convert raw agent text, conversation logs, or transcripts into structured
`ThoughtInput` records using GPT-4o (or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint). Review the
extracted records and append them to your chain.

This feature is enabled by default. Configure with environment variables:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."           # required
export LLM_BASE_URL="https://api.openai.com/v1"  # defaults to OpenAI
export LLM_MODEL="gpt-4o"                # defaults to gpt-4o
```

```rust,ignore
use mentisdb::{LlmExtractionConfig, extract_memories_from_text};

let config = LlmExtractionConfig::from_env()?;
let result = extract_memories_from_text(raw_text, &config, None).await?;

// Review before appending
for thought in &result.thoughts {
    println!("{:?}", thought);
}
```

The extraction uses `openai-rust2` with connection pooling, 3× retry on 429/5xx,
60s timeout, and strict JSON schema validation on the returned payload. LLM output
is **untrusted** — always review and optionally sign extracted thoughts before
appending.

See [docs/llm-extracted-memories-design.md](docs/llm-extracted-memories-design.md) for the full design.

## Retrospective Memory

MentisDB supports a dedicated retrospective workflow for lessons learned.

- Use `mentisdb_append` for ordinary durable facts, constraints, decisions,
  plans, and summaries.
- Use `mentisdb_append_retrospective` after a repeated failure, a long snag,
  or a non-obvious fix when future agents should avoid repeating the same
  struggle.

The retrospective helper:

- defaults `thought_type` to `LessonLearned`
- always stores the thought with `role = Retrospective`
- still supports tags, concepts, confidence, importance, and `refs` to earlier
  thoughts such as the original mistake or correction

---

## Thought Types And Roles

MentisDB currently defines 31 semantic `ThoughtType` values and 9 operational
`ThoughtRole` values.

Thought types:

- `PreferenceUpdate`, `UserTrait`, `RelationshipUpdate`
- `Finding`, `Insight`, `FactLearned`, `PatternDetected`, `Hypothesis`, `Surprise`
- `Mistake`, `Correction`, `LessonLearned`, `AssumptionInvalidated`, `Reframe`
- `Constraint`, `Plan`, `Subgoal`, `Goal`, `Decision`, `StrategyShift`
- `Wonder`, `Question`, `Idea`, `Experiment`
- `ActionTaken`, `TaskComplete`
- `Checkpoint`, `StateSnapshot`, `Handoff`, `Summary`, `LLMExtracted`

Thought roles:

- `Memory`
- `WorkingMemory`
- `Summary`
- `Compression`
- `Checkpoint`
- `Handoff`
- `Audit`
- `Retrospective`
- `Dream` — written by an offline consolidation pass; excluded from retrieval
  by default (see [Dreaming](#dreaming) below)

Use `ThoughtType` to say what the memory means semantically, and `ThoughtRole`
to say how the system should treat it operationally. The crate rustdoc is the
authoritative source for per-variant semantics, and the Agent Guide on the docs
site contains a human-oriented explanation of when to use each one.

String forms round-trip through one canonical mapping: `ThoughtType::ALL` lists
every variant, `as_str()` / `Display` return the canonical PascalCase name, and
`FromStr` accepts any case with separators ignored (`"fact-learned"`,
`"factlearned"`, and `"FactLearned"` all parse to `FactLearned`). Unknown input
returns `ParseThoughtTypeError`, whose message lists the valid types; the REST
and MCP `thought_type` fields use the same parser.

## Dreaming

MentisDB can run an offline, idle-time consolidation pass ("dreaming") over
stored memory. It is **off by default**. See
[docs/dreaming-design.md](docs/dreaming-design.md) for the full design and
its non-negotiables (append-only, no-LLM core, provenance on every write,
suggest-don't-act, off by default).

- Manual trigger: `mentisdb_dream` (MCP), `POST /v1/dream` (REST), or
  `mentisdb dream [--chain <key>] [--dry-run] [--phase <phase,...>]` (CLI).
  Ignores idleness and always runs when invoked.
- Idle scheduler: set `DreamConfig.enabled = true` (or `MENTISDB_DREAM_ENABLED=true`)
  to let the daemon trigger passes automatically on chains that have been
  idle for `idle_after_secs` (default 900s). Every `DreamConfig` field has an
  env var (all read once at startup — restart to apply a change, or edit
  them from the dashboard Settings page, which persists to `.env` and flags
  `restart_required`):
  - `MENTISDB_DREAM_ENABLED` (default `false`) — run the idle scheduler at
    all. Manual triggers ignore this and always run when invoked.
  - `MENTISDB_DREAM_LLM` (default `false`) — opt into the LLM-assisted
    operations below, via `LlmExtractionConfig::from_env`
    (`OPENAI_API_KEY`/`LLM_BASE_URL`/`LLM_MODEL`). Separate from
    `MENTISDB_DREAM_ENABLED` on purpose, since the scheduler runs
    unattended.
  - `MENTISDB_DREAM_IDLE_SECS` (default `900`) — seconds of inactivity
    before a chain is eligible for an automatic pass.
  - `MENTISDB_DREAM_INTERVAL_SECS` (default `3600`) — minimum seconds
    between automatic passes on the same chain.
  - `MENTISDB_DREAM_MAX_SCAN` (default `500`) — thoughts scanned by a pass
    with no prior watermark to resume from (a chain's first pass).
  - `MENTISDB_DREAM_MAX_WRITES` (default `20`) — thoughts a single pass may
    append, shared across consolidation, dedup, recombination, and
    contradiction-check.
  - `MENTISDB_DREAM_RECOMBINATION_BUDGET` (default `3`) — LLM calls per pass
    across recombination and contradiction-check combined.
  - `MENTISDB_DREAM_WEIGHT` (default `0.5`) — score multiplier for
    `Dream`-role thoughts in ranked search when included via
    `include_dreams`.
  - `MENTISDB_DREAM_CHAINS` (default empty) — comma-separated chain-key
    allowlist for the idle scheduler. **Empty means the scheduler only ever
    considers the default chain** (`MENTISDB_DEFAULT_CHAIN_KEY`) — set this
    to cover any other chain automatically.
- Every dream-written thought carries provenance via `ThoughtRole::Dream`,
  the `mentis-dreamer` agent id, and `dream:*` tags. `include_dreams` (on
  `ThoughtQuery` / `RankedSearchQuery` / `recent_context`) opts into seeing
  them; they're excluded from `recent_context`, ranked search, and
  `memory_markdown` by default.
- **Extractive consolidation**: each pass ranks uncovered
  `build_summary_candidates` windows by a salience score (importance × recency
  × in-degree × type boost) and appends one `Summary`/`Dream` digest per
  top-ranked window, tagged `dream:consolidation`, with one `Summarizes`
  relation per source thought. Dream-role and invalidated thoughts are never
  sampled or consolidated.
- **Dedup suggestions**: within the same pass, near-duplicate pairs from the
  *same agent* (cosine ≥ 0.95 on a configured vector sidecar **and** ≥ 0.5
  lexical overlap, not already linked) get one `Finding`/`Dream` thought
  tagged `dream:suggestion`, with `RelatedTo` links to both — never
  `Supersedes`/`Invalidates`/`Corrects`. Treat these as unconfirmed proposals,
  not settled facts. Both operations share `DreamConfig.max_writes_per_pass`
  as a combined budget per pass.
- **Query-time decay**: `RankedSearchQuery::use_decay` (default `false`)
  multiplies each hit's score by an exponential decay curve keyed on a
  per-`ThoughtType`/role half-life table (Long ≈ 365d for `Constraint`,
  `Decision`, `UserTrait`, `PreferenceUpdate`, `LessonLearned`; Short ≈ 7d for
  the `WorkingMemory` role, `Checkpoint`, `StateSnapshot`; Medium ≈ 90d for
  everything else, including `Finding`/`FactLearned`/`Insight`), floored so
  nothing decays to exactly zero. A thought's age is refreshed by its newest
  inbound reference or relation, so being consolidated or cited keeps it
  "alive." Override any type's half-life via
  `DreamConfig.half_life_overrides_days`. `use_decay` only affects ranked
  search — `query()`/`recent_context`/`memory_markdown` are unaffected, and
  search-eval benchmarks are unchanged with it off (the default).
- **LLM-assisted operations** (opt-in via `DreamConfig.llm: Some(LlmExtractionConfig)`;
  everything above works with `llm: None`, the default):
  - **Abstractive consolidation** upgrades a window's extractive digest into
    an LLM-written gist (same window selection, same `Summarizes` relations),
    tagged `dream:consolidation:llm` in addition to `dream:consolidation`,
    at confidence ≤ 0.6. Any LLM failure falls back to the extractive digest.
  - **Recombination** (the REM analog) clusters the scan window's
    above-median-salience thoughts by shared tag/concept, finds pairs of
    clusters whose vector centroids are distant (cosine ≤ 0.3), and asks the
    LLM for at most a few non-obvious, testable connections between them.
    Each accepted connection is a `Hypothesis`/`Idea`/`Wonder`/`Question`
    `Dream` thought (confidence ≤ 0.4) with `DerivedFrom` relations to the
    specific thoughts it cited — citations outside the shown set, unknown
    types, and near-duplicates of existing content (cosine ≥ 0.9) are
    rejected. Tagged `dream:recombination`.
  - **Contradiction-check** looks at pairs of thoughts that are similar but
    not near-duplicates (cosine in `[0.75, 0.95)`, just below the dedup
    band) and asks the LLM whether they directly contradict each other. A
    "yes" appends one `Surprise`/`Dream` thought (confidence 0.4) tagged
    `dream:contradiction` with `RelatedTo` links to both — **never**
    `Contradicts` itself, which is reserved for promotion.
  - Recombination and contradiction-check share one LLM-call budget,
    `DreamConfig.recombination_budget` (default 3 calls/pass, decremented on
    every attempt including rejections); abstractive consolidation's calls
    are bounded by the same `max_writes_per_pass` pool as extractive
    consolidation and dedup. Treat `dream:recombination`/`dream:contradiction`
    thoughts with more skepticism than `dream:suggestion` — they're
    LLM-generated speculation, not a statistical/vector comparison.
  - `run_dream_pass` is `async` because of this LLM path; with `llm: None`
    no LLM code executes.
- **Promotion ("waking up")**: an awake agent or human reviews a dream and
  either promotes it (`promote_dream`) — a plain append of a `Memory`-role
  thought carrying the dream's own content and semantic type, linked
  `DerivedFrom` the dream — or dismisses it (`dismiss_dream`) — a plain
  append of an `Audit`-role `Correction` thought linked `Invalidates` the
  dream, which marks it invalidated immediately. Both leave the original
  dream thought in place for audit; neither is a rewrite. Available as
  `MentisDb::promote_dream`/`dismiss_dream` (library), `mentisdb_promote_dream`/
  `mentisdb_dismiss_dream` (MCP), `POST /v1/dreams/promote`/`dismiss` (REST),
  and `mentisdb dream promote|dismiss <dream_id> --agent <id>` (CLI, `--agent`
  required — the CLI has no other way to know who is reviewing).
- **Dashboard**: the "Dreams" tab lists every chain's dream passes grouped by
  pass, with each pass's report (duration, per-operation counts, token usage)
  and its output thoughts (type/tag/status badges, content preview), a small
  chart of thoughts-written-per-pass over time, and Promote / Edit-and-promote
  / Dismiss buttons per output thought.

### Memory Scopes

MentisDB defines a `MemoryScope` enum that controls how far a thought should propagate:

- `User` (default) — visible to all agents and sessions sharing the chain
- `Session` — visible only within the current agent session
- `Agent` — visible only to the agent that created it

Scopes are stored as tags on the thought:

- `scope:user`
- `scope:session`
- `scope:agent`

Crate API:

- `ThoughtInput::with_scope(MemoryScope)` sets the scope on append
- `RankedSearchQuery::with_scope(MemoryScope)` filters search results by scope

REST API:

- `POST /v1/thoughts` accepts an optional `scope` field (`"user"`, `"session"`, or `"agent"`)
- `POST /v1/ranked-search` and `POST /v1/context-bundles` accept an optional `scope` field

## Shared-Chain Multi-Agent Use

Multiple agents can write to the same `chain_key`.

Each stored thought carries a stable:

- `agent_id`

Agent profile metadata now lives in the per-chain agent registry instead of
being duplicated into every thought record. Registry records can store:

- `display_name`
- `agent_owner`
- `description`
- `aliases`
- `status`
- `public_keys`
- per-chain activity counters such as `thought_count`, `first_seen_index`, and `last_seen_index`

That allows a shared chain to represent memory from:

- multiple agents in one workflow
- multiple named roles in one orchestration system
- multiple tenants or owners writing to the same chain namespace

Queries can filter by:

- `agent_id`
- `agent_name`
- `agent_owner`

Administrative tools can also inspect and mutate the agent registry directly,
so agents can be documented, disabled, aliased, or provisioned with public keys
before they start writing thoughts.
